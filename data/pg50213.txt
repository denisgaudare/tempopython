LESSON XII

HARMONIOUS COMBINATIONS OF FOOD AND TABLES OF DIGESTIVE HARMONIES AND
DISHARMONIES


CHEMICAL CHANGES PRODUCED BY COOKING

The application of heat to food is comparatively of recent origin in
the evolution of mankind. The use of fire involves a certain amount
of mental ingenuity, and could not be practised by man's anthropoid
ancestors. Anthropoid animals, whether human or ape, have a great
amount of curiosity for the unusual and the new.

Man probably began his cooking experiments by soaking hard foods
in warm water, then in hot water, or by warming cold foods at his
camp-fire. As heat volatilizes the pleasant odorous substance present
in many foods, the custom of heating them probably became popular. The
habit of cooking spread, as many other novel and interesting customs
have spread, from this primitive process to the French chef, regardless
of whether the results were beneficial or harmful.

The question whether foods should be eaten cooked or uncooked can best
be answered by examining the chemical and mechanical changes produced
in the process of cooking, and their consequent physiological effects.

Cooking may be divided into two classes, namely, MOIST HEAT and DRY
HEAT. To illustrate:

[Sidenote: Effect of heat on sugars]

Sugars are not chemically affected by boiling with water, while starch,
cooked with boiling water, or steam, absorbs from three to five times
its bulk of moisture, and changes into a soft, pasty, or semi-dissolved
mass. Under dry heat, sugars are converted into a brown substance,
known as caramel, while starch cooked under a temperature of 300°
to 400° of dry heat, is changed into a dextrin, of which toast and
zwieback are examples.

[Sidenote: Effect of heat on fats]

Fats are not changed chemically by moist heat; that is, by being boiled
in water, but the globules are melted and the hot fat spreads in a
film over other material which may be present. In dry heat, fats are
chemically decomposed, forming irritating vapors. The odors of frying
fat are due to the presence of small quantities of these decomposition
products. In larger quantities, and with greater heat, these substances
are exceedingly irritating to the mucous membrane of the stomach and
the intestines.

[Sidenote: Effect of heat on proteids]

The chemical changes produced by heating proteids are of much
more importance than are those which take place in other foods.
Simple proteids, such as albumin and globulin, are coagulated at a
temperature of about 160°. This change is familiar in the coagulation
of egg whites under low temperature. Other proteids undergo similar
changes, governed by the degree and kind of heat (dry or moist), to
which they are subjected. This change in proteid material continues
with the application of prolonged heat, until the proteid, under dry
heat, is converted into a dark brittle mass, wholly insoluble and
indigestible.

If the student will take the white of an egg, and bake it for some
time in an oven, he will observe the coagulation or hardening of the
proteid. The chemical nature of this change is one of great complexity.
The molecules combine with each other, forming almost indestructible
substances. The combined or coagulated forms of proteid are represented
in nature by horns, hoofs, finger nails, and hair.


STARCH DIGESTION--COOKED AND UNCOOKED

[Sidenote: Comparative digestion of cooked and uncooked grain]

The student will remember the reference made in Lesson V to experiments
concerning the digestibility of starch when taken in various forms. In
these experiments, though conducted for the purpose of demonstrating
the supposed advantage of excessive cooking, the results showed that
at the time the contents of the stomach were removed, all the proteids
of the uncooked grain had been digested, while the percentage of
proteid digested from the various forms of cooked grain grew less as
the cooking was increased. As the chief function of the gastric juice
is the digestion of proteids, the real significance of the above
experiments was exactly the opposite from that which was intended to be
proved.

[Sidenote: Reasons given for cooking starch]

The statement is frequently made that the starch of grain cannot be
digested without cooking, because the cells enclosing the starch
grains have indigestible or insoluble cellulose walls. The old theory
is that cooking expands the starch and ruptures or tears down these
walls, freeing the contents so that the digestive juices may act upon
the enclosed starch granules. This is a theory unsupported by facts.
The cell walls on the interior of the grain kernel are very filmy,
and in the mature grain scarcely exist at all. The analysis of wheat
flour shows only a trace of cellulose fiber. Were these cellulose walls
within the wheat grain, as this theory commonly teaches, flour would
show a liberal quantity of cellulose. The cellulose wall theory, as a
necessity for cooking starch, is an excellent illustration of the ease
with which a groundless statement or theory may be used to prove or to
explain some popular prejudice.

In the process of cooking, the tendency is to render the organic salts
contained in food entirely inorganic. This change from organic to
inorganic salts is measured by the temperature to which the foods
are subjected. Many of these salts are combined with the nitrogenous
constituents of food, therefore when subjected to certain degrees
of heat they are of little value in the construction of the proteid
molecules within the body. This is especially true of fresh or green
vegetables.


EXCUSES FOR COOKING OUR FOOD

[Sidenote: Ancestral habits not inherited]

Inasmuch as the majority of people favor cooking, probably forgetting
that about half of the food consumed in the world at the present time
is taken in its natural or uncooked state, it may be well to mention
some of the views advanced by those who believe that the present diet
of cooked grain is better for modern man than an elementary diet, and
who attempt to give a natural explanation. One theory is that man has
subsisted so long upon cooked foods that his organs have become fitted
for a cooked diet, and a cooked diet only. Another view sometimes
advanced is, that while cooked foods were originally detrimental, yet
by continued use man has become fitted for such a diet and unfitted
for a natural diet. These are but other forms of the old belief in
the inheritance of acquired characteristics. This belief, however, is
steadily losing ground among evolutionists. There is no more reason to
believe that a modified function of the stomach would be inherited,
than there is to believe that small feet would be inherited among the
Chinese women just because these organs are mutilated by local custom.

The best light of scientific knowledge now leads us to believe that the
healthy child of today is, in its capacity for nutrition, essentially
like the primitive child, and would thrive best upon a varied diet of
natural foods.


EXPERIMENT UPON ANIMALS

While I do not claim that the methods of animal feeding apply
accurately to man, yet the digestive and the assimilative processes of
animals are so closely related to the human processes, that the results
obtained in animal nutrition are very instructive to the student of
human food science.

About thirty years ago, when the scientific study of agriculture first
became prevalent, an experiment was made in cooked food for animals,
upon an extensive basis. At that time it was the universal belief that
man owed much of his superiority over other animals to the use of
cooked food. This argument was put forth with great force and appeared
quite reasonable. It was asked whether animals other than man would be
benefited by changing to a cooked bill of fare.

[Sidenote: Governmental experiments on cooked food for animals]

During this agitation numerous western farmers put their hogs,
chickens, cows, horses, and sheep upon a cooked bill of fare, and many
enthusiastic feeders claimed beneficial results. Later the various
Governmental Experimental Stations took up the subject and made many
careful, complete, and comparative tests of the effects of cooked and
uncooked food for animals. The result did not show the expected thing.
The cooking experiments in the majority of cases proved injurious, and
the general decision of the Government investigators was that cooking
food for animals was useless and detrimental to the great live stock
industry. Stock food cookery has now become entirely obsolete.

[Sidenote: Cooking a habit of civilization]

Man is the only animal that cooks his food, and has made great progress
in civilization while subsisting on a cooked diet, but cooking is no
more the cause of his advancement than silk hats and swallow-tailed
coats. He has advanced only according to the degree that he has
thought, studied, and experimented. Cooking has undoubtedly enabled man
to utilize many things as food, that he could not and would not have
used otherwise, but whether this has aided or retarded in his material
progress is yet an unsolved question.


FOOD COMBINATIONS

The following tables are designed to convey, in the most condensed and
simplified form, the results of my investigations in regard to food
combinations.

It is somewhat difficult to give in any one table exact information
concerning food combinations under the varying conditions of the body
and its ever-changing requirements. The best that can be done is to
lay out such groups as are fundamentally harmonious from a chemical
point of view.

[Sidenote: Quantity an important factor]

The particular condition of the patient often reveals certain special
requirements which must be dealt with according to the symptoms given
off by the body. Many of these combinations, when taken under certain
conditions, may appear disagreeable, but this can be overcome by
leveling the proportions and limiting the quantity. Quantity is of very
great importance for the reason that the most perfect selections of
food can be made and blended into perfect chemical harmony, and still
disagree with the normal stomach if a quantity is taken in excess of
physical demands.

The use of these tables will serve to bring to the student's attention
the advantage to be gained from a health-giving and curative point of
view, as well as from simplicity in diet.

In considering the chemical harmony of foods, the student should keep
in mind the time required for digestion, which involves not only the
question of combining foods at the same meal, but also the taking,
within a few hours after eating, of other articles that may produce
chemical inharmony. For example: Milk, cereals, and sweet fruits are in
chemical harmony, but a lemonade introduced into the stomach an hour or
two later would produce inharmony, and be almost as harmful as if it
had been taken with the meal.

[Sidenote: Instinct a safe guide, if cultivated]

There are many injurious combinations which the student will learn to
omit from a sense of taste and instinct, and while our instincts have
in many cases ceased to guide us aright, they will rapidly return and
assume command if given a fair opportunity.

The perfect meal can be made from three or four articles, and the
entire menu can be changed three times a day, but to take eight, ten,
or a dozen things at the same meal, puts the quantity, as well as every
article composing the meal, into jeopardy.

After one has eaten a sufficient quantity of food, and the taste has
signalled "ENOUGH," something sweet or pungent is introduced. This
puts into activity another set of taste buds which will accept a given
quantity of another food. However, the stomach has already given off
one signal of "enough," hence every pennyweight taken in excess of that
amount is that much more than should be eaten.

In order to simplify the making of harmonious combinations, I have
grouped the foods whose use I recommend in nine different divisions.
A further subdivision of vegetables and fruits might have been made,
but this would have increased the number of groups, making them more
complicated and less practical.


HOW TO INTERPRET THE TABLES

In order to ascertain the articles with which any special food will
combine, the student should turn to the table headed with the desired
article of that group. If foods from three groups are to be considered,
the student will look for two of them in the first vertical column on
the left-hand side of the page, and will then follow across to the
vertical column for the third article.

    Figure (1) means especially beneficial
    Figure (2) means good combinations
    Figure (3) means somewhat undesirable
    Figure (4) means particularly harmful

(a) "Fats with" figure (1), under the heading _Grains_, first table,
page 609, means that the combination of "fats with grains" would be
"especially beneficial."

(b) "Fats and eggs with" figure (2), under the heading _Milk_, page
609, means that "fats and eggs with milk" make a good combination.

(c) "Fats and milk with" figure (3), page 609, under column headed
_Nuts_, means a "somewhat undesirable" combination.

(d) "Fats and acid fruits with" figure (4), under heading _Milk_, page
609, means that this combination would be "particularly harmful," etc.

It is impractical to print ready reference tables showing the
harmony of more than three articles, but the student can judge this
sufficiently well for himself by comparing the respective harmonies of
the several foods of the group.

    CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS
    AND
    FOOD TABLES




LESSON XIII

SIMPLE CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS


While there is a dominating substance in all foods, yet they usually
contain many compounds which render them, from a chemical standpoint,
very difficult to classify accurately. For example, the principal
nutrients in wheat are carbohydrates (starch and sugar), yet wheat
contains mineral salts, fat, and protein, the latter being a compound
consisting of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Wheat
would, therefore, be placed in the carbohydrate class, but it would
overlap into several other classes. What is true of wheat, is true of
nearly all other articles of food. Furthermore, foods do not chemically
reproduce themselves when taken into the body, but in the process of
metabolism they are converted either into other elements or into other
compounds. From this it will be understood that the articles listed
under the following headings are classified according to the nutritive
substance which predominates in them, and are given for the purpose of
guiding the practitioner in the selection of such foods as will supply
the various chemical constituents of the body.

Foods which contain two or more substances in generous proportions
may appear under two or more of the following headings, as in the
case of peanuts. This humble article of food contains 19 per cent
carbohydrates, 20 per cent protein, and 29 per cent fat, hence it is
listed under the three headings--carbohydrates, proteids, and fats.

The tables comprise the best selections of food available in all
countries and at all seasons of the year. They contain everything the
body needs under the varying conditions of age, climate, and activity,
except, perhaps, in some parts of the frigid zone.

In compiling these tables I have selected only such articles of food as
experience has proved most useful.

PURPOSES WHICH THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF FOOD SERVE IN THE HUMAN BODY

While all the articles of food in the four above-named classifications
contain other elements than the one under which heading they appear,
yet the body uses or appropriates them for the following purposes:


PURPOSE OF CARBOHYDRATES

The carbohydrate substance in food is used by the body chiefly for
the purpose of keeping up body-weight; that is, for the purpose of
supplying the various fluids which fill the cell-structure. If one is
suffering from emaciation, the carbohydrate element in food should
predominate. While some of the more soluble proteids, especially milk
and eggs, will give a rapid gain in weight, the weight will not be
permanent unless sufficient carbohydrates are taken to supply the
blood with all the required elements of nutrition, or, in other words,
to level or to balance the body requirements.


PURPOSE OF FATS

Fats are used by the animal body primarily for the purpose of producing
heat. Food is burned or oxidized in the blood, undergoing very much the
same action as does the combustion of coal in a grate. The heat thus
generated is delegated to the blood, and the blood, by its circulation,
distributes this heat throughout the body. The carbon dioxid or waste
matter formed during the circulation, is carried to the lungs, where
it reunites with the oxygen which we breathe, and thereby again passes
back into the atmosphere.


PURPOSE OF PROTEIDS

Proteid is a compound containing chiefly nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon.
Its purpose is to form the muscular and the tissue structure of the
body. To use a homely illustration, proteid may be compared to the
material which makes the honeycomb, while the carbohydrate substance
may be compared to the honey; that is, to the fluids which fill the
cells.

Those performing heavy or active muscular labor should eat liberally of
the proteid class of foods.

Under normal conditions, natural hunger will call for the quantity of
proteid needed. The tendency, however, should be toward the minimum;
that is, one should take the lowest quantity of proteid that the body
requires to keep up the cell-structure. (See Lesson VI, p. 216.) Modern
investigations have shown that, in many cases of extreme athletic
tests, a low proteid diet has given the greatest endurance. This is
accounted for by the fact that nearly all carbohydrates, especially of
the grain family, contain from 8 to 12 per cent of proteids, which is
quite sufficient, in many instances, to supply the body with all the
tissue-building material necessary.

Inasmuch as the several nutritive elements found in a single article of
food are better proportioned by Nature, than man can usually proportion
them, the relation of one substance to another will be better divided
if the entire meal be made to consist of only one kind of food, and
both digestion and assimilation will therefore be more perfect. Under
these conditions the blood will be laden with very little waste matter,
which is the thing that reduces our powers of endurance. Therefore,
when it is possible to secure the carbohydrate, the proteid, and the
fatty substances from a single article of food which will give to
the body greater strength and endurance than when we secure these
substances from several sources, we should confine our menus to single
articles of well-proportioned food. This thought, carried to its
logical end, leads one more and more, as experience progresses, toward
the mono-diet system.


PURPOSE OF MINERAL SALTS

Mineral salts serve two distinct purposes in the body:

     1 They assist in building up the cartilage and the body-structure

     2 They assist in the digestion, and in the dissolution of other
     foods, especially of the carbohydrate group, and more especially
     of the grain family

Grains are very difficult to subdivide into their constituent elements;
that is, to reduce to a solution so fine that assimilation will be
perfect. A liberal use of the foods containing mineral salts aids very
materially in this process of solution.


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIGESTIBILITY AND ASSIMILABILITY

The true interpretation of the word "digestion" is the preparation of
food by the action of:

    1 The saliva
    2 The gastric juice
    3 The bile, and
    4 The pancreatic juice

When food is properly prepared by mastication by the time it reaches
the pancreas, it should be thoroughly split up or subdivided, in which
state it is ready for assimilation.

The true interpretation of the word "assimilation" is the absorption of
all food substances through the walls of the intestinal tract, and the
final passing of them into the circulation.

It is nothing unusual, however, for a person to become afflicted with
predigestion, and, at the same time, with poor or faulty assimilation;
in other words, digestion being too rapid, and assimilation being too
slow. This condition frequently occurs in cases of superacidity. On
account of the excess of acid, the food digests or passes from the
stomach prematurely; that is, before it has been dissolved by the
action of the hydrochloric acid. The food, thus super-charged with
acid, passes from the stomach into the lower intestines, and sets up
a condition of irritation. This irritation or swelling of the mucous
surface (lining) of the intestines, closes the small canals, or winking
valves, as they are sometimes called, thus seriously interfering with
the passing of the dissolved food matter into the circulation.

       *       *       *       *       *

The following table is designed to show the comparative assimilability
of the leading articles of food, together with their starch, sugar, and
water content:

[A] While all the vegetables mentioned in the above table belong to
the carbohydrate class, yet the starch element contained in them is
very much more assimilable than the starch contained in grains or
legumes, therefore these vegetables may be eaten freely by those having
rheumatic or gouty tendencies.

The starch and the sugar content in fresh vegetables appears low owing
to the fact that they contain a large percentage of water. Eliminating
the water, these foods rank in their starch and sugar content with
cereals and legumes, and are much more easily digested and assimilated.
In other words, if the chemist should reduce the water content to the
same per cent as that of cereals, the carbohydrate content would rise
in the same ratio as the water content is reduced. Both the starch and
the sugar content of these vegetables is more digestible, and more
readily assimilated than the starch and the sugar found in cereals and
legumes.


PURPOSE OF THE VIENO TABLE

The student should remember that not only the quantity but the quality
of food must be considered. The vieno system of food measurement, as
herein explained, is the simplest system of food measurement that has
ever been published. It is amply complete, and accurate enough for the
purpose for which it is intended, and that is the calculation of the
energy and the available nitrogen contained in natural dietaries.

This measurement is really a quantitative measurement; that is, it
measures the quantity, not the quality. In order to have a full
knowledge of a bill of fare, it is necessary to know, in addition to
the quantity, the exact chemical nature of each particular food, and
also to know the other foods with which that food will combine.

This food table tells accurately the amount of energy that may be
derived from food by chemical analysis, but it does not tell the
amount of energy that the body must expend in the work of assimilation.
This cannot be given in a table, because it varies with the individual
and the condition of his digestive organs.




LESSON XIV

    VIENO SYSTEM
    OF
    FOOD MEASUREMENT




LESSON XIV

VIENO SYSTEM OF FOOD MEASUREMENT


The amount of nutrition contained in a given quantity of food is often
a determining factor in curative dietetics.

The two most important things to be considered in prescribing foods are:

     1 The amount of energy contained in a given quantity

     2 The amount of available nitrogen or tissue-building material in
     a given quantity


ENERGY

Energy is the power to do work. That form of energy with which we are
most familiar is mechanical energy, as raising a stone or turning a
wheel.

Heat is another form of energy. Heat and work can be converted into
each other. The steam-engine turns heat into work, while a "hot box" on
a car-wheel is a case of work being turned back into heat.

[Sidenote: Amount of heat a food produces determines its energy]

Experience shows that a definite amount of heat will yield a definite
amount of work, so that the amount of heat produced by a given amount
of food, when combined with oxygen, is taken as a measure of its
energy. This is ordinarily expressed in calories, a calorie being the
amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one thousand grams
of water one degree on the centigrade thermometer scale.

The use of these terms need not concern the student. Instead of using
the calorie I will use a unit which is equal to one hundred calories. I
have selected a unit of this size because it gives about the ordinary
service of food at meals which is easily measured and remembered.


NITROGEN

Nitrogen is the chemical element that is most concerned with the
function of life. All animal tissue contains nitrogen, which forms
about one-sixth part, by weight, of all the nitrogenous or protein
substances.

[Sidenote: Proportion of Nitrogen in lean meat]

If we were to take a hundred pounds of lean meat, or muscle, and
evaporate from it all the water, we would have about eighteen pounds
of dry material left. If we should analyze this dry substance, we
would find that about one-sixth, or three pounds, would be the
element nitrogen. Thus we say that muscle contains eighteen per cent
of protein, or three per cent of nitrogen. In ordinary practise the
protein is mixed with fats and salts, and cannot be measured by simply
drying out the water, so the chemist finds the amount of nitrogen
present and multiplies by 6.25, which gives about the correct per
cent of protein. This method is not exact because the per cent of
nitrogen in various proteids is not always the same, but it will give
an intelligent average. I will discard the use of the term protein, and
refer to the amount of nitrogen directly.

All compounds of the element nitrogen are not available as food. For
example: The nitrogen of the air, of ammonia gas, or gunpowder cannot
be utilized in the animal body. The nitrogen in foods only refers to
available nitrogen. Compounds containing other forms of nitrogen are
not foods, but are frequently poisons.


SYSTEMS OF FOOD MEASUREMENTS COMPARED

THE "OLD" SYSTEM

Under the old system of food measurement, feeding the human body cannot
be made a practical science for the masses, therefore a new system
becomes necessary. That we may more fully appreciate the value of a
new system, let us consider the methods hitherto available.

Suppose a man is using two quarts of milk a day, and wishes to
determine the amount of available nitrogen or tissue-building material
and energy it contains. Under the old system he must get a book on
food analysis, or send to Washington for a Government bulletin. If he
does not understand the meaning of the terms and figures used, the
tables would be useless to him until he goes to a chemist to have them
explained. He is now ready to work out the nutritive value of his milk,
and proceeds as follows:

First, he gets the number of cu cm in the milk, thus--952.8 (number
cu cm in 1 quart) x 2 = 1905.6, number of cu cm in 2 quarts of milk.
Second, he gets the weight of his milk in grams--1.032 (number grams
in 1 cu cm of milk) x 1905.6 = 1966.57, number of grams in 2 quarts of
milk.

He now turns to a table of analysis which tells him that milk contains
3 per cent of protein, 3-1/2 per cent of fat, and 4-1/2 per cent of
sugar. As the amount of nitrogen in milk is approximately one-sixth of
its entire protein, he would now get 16 per cent of the 3 per cent (.16
x .03 = .0048), which is the percentage of nitrogen contained in milk.

His next step would be--1966.57 (number grams in 2 quarts of milk) x
.0048 = 9.44, the number of grams of nitrogen in 2 quarts of milk.

I will not explain the way in which the energy would have to be
figured, but will merely give the arithmetical processes by which the
result is obtained:

         3    ×  4.1  = 12.3
         3.5  ×  9.3  = 32.55
         4.5  ×  4.1  = 18.45
        12.3  + 32.55 + 18.45 = 63.30
      1966.57 × 63.30 = 124483.88
    124483.88 ÷  100  = 1244, the No. of calories or
        energy (heat units) contained in two quarts of milk.


THE NEW OR "VIENO" SYSTEM

[Sidenote: Derivation of the word Vieno]

To a unit of food-energy which is equal to one hundred calories (see
last paragraph on "Energy"), I have given the name of _Vieno_, derived
from "vital" and "energy," and pronounced _vi-eń-o_. The Vieno
system, therefore, will measure all foods by vi-en-os, or units of
energy equal to one hundred of the chemist's calories. One vieno of
milk is one-sixth of a quart, or two-thirds of an ordinary glass. From
this it is readily seen that two quarts of milk will give twelve vienos
of energy, or, if we wish to express it in the chemist's term, twelve
hundred calories.

[Sidenote: How to compute amount of nitrogen in food]

The table also states that milk has a nitrogen factor of .8. Therefore,
if we wish to know the amount of nitrogen in the two quarts of
milk, all we need do is to multiply the number =of= vienos by the
nitrogen factor; 12 x .8 = 9.6, which figure represents the nitrogen
consumption expressed in grams. (See explanation of fourth column of
table.) These results are practically the same as those obtained by
the old system of computation, but expressed in simpler terms. Thus we
see that the vieno system of computing food values is unique in its
simplicity, and will be a very material aid in putting Food Science on
a practical basis.


NECESSITY FOR A SIMPLE SYSTEM

[Sidenote: Neither volume nor weight are correct standards for
measuring food values]

Things are commonly measured by volume, or by weight. That volume could
not be made sufficiently accurate in the measurement of food values is
evident. A bushel of lettuce leaves would contain much less food value
than a bushel of wheat. Weight would seem to be a fairer way to compare
foods, but all foods contain water, which may vary from five to
ninety-five per cent. A pound of turnips, which is nine-tenths water,
would not be comparable with sugar, which has scarcely any water.

Even if it were not for the water, weight would not be a fair method of
comparison because some foods are of more value per pound than others,
owing to their difference in chemical composition. For instance, a
pound of butter gives about two and one-fourth times as much heat to
the body as sugar.

As before mentioned, the two chief food factors which we ought to
measure are energy-producing and tissue-building power.

[Sidenote: What constitutes a true food]

All true foods when assimilated in the body produce some energy. In
fact, only such substances as produce bodily energy, when combined with
the oxygen taken in through the lungs, can be correctly termed food.

I have taken this energy-producing power of food as the best basis
for measurement and comparison. The nitrogen could have been taken
as a unit, and the energy figured by a table, but it is simpler to
use energy as a unit (as given in column 3, p. 655), and figure the
nitrogen in the various foods by means of a table which gives the
amount of nitrogen per unit of energy. (Column 4, p. 655.)

Multiplication of units of energy (column 3) by the nitrogen factor
(column 4) is necessary because the ratio of nitrogen to energy is
different in each food.


EXPLANATION OF TABLE

In the table that follows, I have attempted to give in the simplest way
the amount of each particular food that one vieno equals.

The second column shows, in the plainest language possible, what one
vieno of food equals--as, one vieno of barley equals one ounce; or,
one vieno of nuts equals one rounded tablespoonful, etc. This method
is, of course, only approximate, as in some foods it is impossible
to find a simple term to express the amount of one vieno. This is
especially true of cooked foods because of the varied amounts of water
contained. In such cases the way for the student to become familiar
with a vieno is to weigh one pound of the raw material, and, after it
is cooked, weigh it again, and then calculate the water content.

The definition given in the second column in the case of milk, butter,
eggs, and cheese is fairly accurate. The description given in the case
of cereals and bread is also fairly accurate. In the list of fresh
vegetables, no attempt has been made to describe one vieno by volume,
as, vegetables being loose and bulky, it is practical to measure them
only by weight.

[Sidenote: Only the edible portion of food considered]

In the case of fresh fruits, one vieno has been defined as "one large
orange" or "six plums," etc. In such cases allowance for the non-edible
portion has been made; all weights given in the table consider only the
edible portion.

In the case of nuts, the definition of a vieno in so many spoonfuls
is fairly accurate. This is done only as an illustration, and not
continued throughout the table. The student should use only the
second column of the table for rough work, and to help him figure the
approximate amount of one vieno.

The third column of the table, which gives the number of vienos or the
amount of heat-energy in one pound, is the column to which the student
should refer in his work. A pound of food referred to in this column
invariably means one pound of the edible portion.

[Sidenote: Simple method of reducing food to vienos]

The way for the student to calculate the amount of food in one vieno is
to take a pound of the food that he is to use and divide it equally
into as many portions as the number in the third column. For example:
If one pound of wheat is given as equal to sixteen vienos, the student
should weigh a pound of wheat and divide it into sixteen portions, and
each of these portions will equal one vieno.

[Sidenote: The nitrogen factor simplified]

The fourth column of the table gives the approximate nitrogen factor;
that is, the percentage of nitrogen by weight in one vieno. This column
is to be used for computing the amount of nitrogen in the diet under
all ordinary circumstances. The student should take the total number of
vienos of each food and multiply this number by the nitrogen factor.
The product will be the approximate amount of the nitrogen consumed,
expressed in grams. _This is the direct method of ascertaining the
amount of available nitrogen in food._

[Sidenote: Grams reduced to vienos]

If in reading other works, the student finds the amount of nitrogen
given in decigrams, he needs only to divide by ten in order to reduce
it to this system, as a decigram is one-tenth of a gram. Likewise,
protein can be reduced to grams, or decigrams, by a simple process
of multiplication and division, as follows: Sixty grams of protein
contains practically ten grams (one hundred decigrams) of nitrogen.
Divide the amount of protein by six to change protein to the nitrogen
unit. That is (Protein ÷ 6) = amount of nitrogen in grams.

The old-fashioned food table gave the amount of protein in per cent by
weight, making it necessary to weigh the food, figure the amount of
protein by multiplying the weight by the per cent, and then reducing
this according to the rule given above. I explain this so that the
student may be able to compare results expressed in the old table, with
the vieno method, but in all practical work the student should use
only this _direct_ method which is much more simple and accurate.

The fifth column of the table gives the weight of one vieno in grams.
This adds no new information, but only gives the weight of one vieno in
the metric system. It should be used by those who wish to be accurate
in their work, or by those who take a scientific interest in their
dietary.

[Sidenote: Examples for the student who desires to be exact]

The last column of the table gives the actual amount of nitrogen in
one vieno of food expressed in grams. This is the accurate figure
from which the approximate nitrogen factor for ordinary use has been
derived. For example: The actual amount of nitrogen in one vieno of
chestnuts is .396. If this number is multiplied by the number of
vienos of chestnuts eaten, we would have the actual number of grams of
nitrogen consumed. Suppose ten vienos of chestnuts are eaten; we would
multiply .396 by ten, which would give us 3.96 grams of nitrogen. For
ordinary purposes, I use the nearest decimal, which is .4, and which
I give in the fourth column as the nitrogen factor. Those who wish to
figure the nitrogen with scientific accuracy should use the figures
given in the last column of the table, as in the example I have given.

The Vieno system of food measurement is new, and is intended to give
to the practitioner and to the housewife the greatest aid in balancing
or proportioning the diet. I have therefore included in the following
tables, all classes of foods, many of which I do not recommend or use
in my scientific work.

CURATIVE AND REMEDIAL MENUS


INTRODUCTION

[Sidenote: Scientific eating leads toward simplicity]

Scientific eating consists in selecting the food the body requires
according to age, occupation, and climate. These requirements can be
supplied with a very few articles. The necessary changes in diet can
always be made by varying the proportions. It is possible to select,
for each of the four seasons of the year, three or four articles that
will contain all the elements of nourishment the body needs, therefore
true food science leads one inevitably toward the mono-diet plan; that
is, making a meal of only one kind of food. Owing to our inherent
desire to sit at the "groaning table" we may yet be a long distance
from the mono-diet plan, but the science of human nutrition points
with unerring certainty toward simplicity. It should be remembered,
however, that one may eat, under nearly all conditions except extreme
superacidity all he desires of one or two things--one preferred.

[Sidenote: How foods become curative]

In the light of modern medicine, no food has any specific curative
property. Foods become curative only as they remove abnormal
conditions, and they will remove abnormal conditions just to the extent
that they can be perfectly digested and assimilated, and to the extent
that waste matter is thoroughly eliminated from the body. In this
way all possible resistance is removed, and Nature will build up the
dis-eased and broken-down tissue in obedience to the law of animal
evolution. This constructive process we call "curing."

While the menus for each season of the year may seem to vary but
little, especially when compared with the conventional omnivorous diet,
yet experience has proved that the fewer the articles composing the
meal, the better will be the results.


COOKING

SOME IMPORTANT FACTS REVEALED BY MODERN SCIENCE

The object of cooking is to tear down the cell-structure of foods, and
to make them more digestible. After the cell-structure is demolished,
every degree of heat to which foods are subjected injures the foods
instead of improving them.


GRAINS

Grains should be cooked whole. They should be cleansed, well covered
with water, and boiled until the grains burst open as in making
old-fashioned corn hominy. This will often take from three to four
hours' constant boiling.

Cereals prepared in this way are more delicious, more nourishing, and
far more healthful than any of the prepared or patented "breakfast
foods," while the cost is perhaps about one-eighth or one-tenth of that
of the popular patented products.


VEGETABLES

The old or popular method of cooking vegetables is to cover them
generously with water and to boil them much longer than is necessary,
then to drain off the water, season, and serve. By this process the
mineral salts, in many cases the most valuable part of the food, are
dissolved, passed into the water, and lost. In this way many excellent
articles of food are greatly impoverished and reduced perhaps 50 per
cent in nutritive value.

The time vegetables are cooked should be measured by their solidity.
As an example, spinach can be thoroughly cooked in about fifteen
minutes. In this way some of its elements are volatilized, giving it a
delicious flavor and taste, while if cooked in an abundance of water,
from half to three-quarters of an hour, which is the customary way, its
best nutritive elements are lost by draining away the water, and it is
rendered almost tasteless.


COOKING EN CASSEROLE

All succulent and watery vegetables such as cabbage and spinach, beans,
carrots, onions, parsnips, peas, squash, turnips, etc., should be
cooked in a casserole dish.

Prepare vegetables in the usual manner as for boiling. A few
tablespoonfuls of water may be added to such articles as green beans
and peas, beets, carrots, cauliflower, onions, parsnips, etc. Cover,
and place in an ordinary baking oven until the vegetable is thoroughly
cooked or softened. In this way vegetables in reality are cooked
in their own juices, rendered much softer, more digestible, more
delicious, and all their mineral salts and other nutritive elements are
preserved, making them also more nutritious.


RICE AND MACARONI

Rice, macaroni, and spaghetti are exceptions to the above rules. They
should be cooked in an abundance of water and thoroughly drained. In
this way the excess of starch which they contain is disposed of, and
their nutritive elements are better balanced. They are also rendered
much more palatable and digestible.


FRUITS

If fruits can be obtained thoroughly ripe, they should never be cooked.

Dried or evaporated fruits can be prepared for the table by soaking
them thoroughly in plain water for a few hours, or over night. In this
way the green and inferior pieces are exposed and can be discarded.
The excess of water can be boiled down to a sirup and poured over the
fruit. In this way the fruit-sugar is developed, and sweetening with
cane-sugar becomes unnecessary.

Soaking as above described is merely a process of putting back into the
fruit the water that was taken out of it by evaporation or dehydration.

It is evident that that part of the fruit which will not soften
sufficiently by soaking, to become palatable, was not ripe enough for
food.


CANNED FOODS

The average table, especially hotels and restaurants, are supplied
largely from canned foods. A process of perfect preservation of foods
has never been invented and probably never will be. No matter how
well foods may taste, they undergo constant chemical changes from the
time they leave the ground or parent stalk until they are thoroughly
decomposed. All vegetables, therefore, should be used fresh, if
possible.


BUTTERMILK

An excellent quality of buttermilk may be made as follows: Allow sweet
milk to stand (well covered) in a warm room until it thickens or
coagulates; whip with an ordinary rotary egg beater without removing
the cream.


HOME-MADE BUTTER

Sweet butter may be made in a few minutes from ordinary cream by
placing it in a deep bowl and whipping with a rotary egg beater.


SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE SELECTION AND THE PREPARATION OF CERTAIN
ARTICLES MENTIONED IN THE MENUS

THE BANANA

The banana is a vegetable. It is one of our most valuable foods, as
well as the most prolific. It will produce more food per acre, with
less care and labor, than any other plant that grows.

While the banana grows only in the tropical countries, it is equally as
good and useful to people of the northern zones.

Bananas that are transported to the North are cut green, and often
immature; that is, before they have attained their full growth. This
latter variety should never be used. In their green and unripened
state, they are wholly unfit for food, and for these reasons there has
arisen a broadcast prejudice against this most excellent article of
diet.


HOW TO SELECT AND RIPEN BANANAS

Care should be exercised to select the largest variety--only those that
have attained their full growth on the parent tree. If bananas cannot
be procured "dead ripe" from the dealer, they should be purchased, if
possible, by the bunch, or a few of the lower "hands" can be purchased
and left on the stalk. They should be kept in the open air (that is,
uncovered), in an even, warm temperature, and the end of the stalk
covered with a clean white cloth, or immersed in water, kept fresh by
changing daily. In this way the banana will mature, ripen slowly, and
be almost as delicious as if obtained ripe from its native tree.

Bananas should not be eaten until they are "dead ripe"--black spotted.
In this state, the carbohydrates which they contain are as readily
digestible as fresh milk.


BAKED BANANAS

Peel large ripe bananas; bake in an open pan in a very hot oven from
ten to fifteen minutes, or until slightly brown.

Baked bananas make a delicious dessert served with either of the
following:

    a CREAM
    b NUT BUTTER
    c DAIRY BUTTER
    d BOTH DAIRY BUTTER AND A SAUCE MADE BY
        GRADUALLY DILUTING NUT BUTTER WITH A
        LITTLE WATER, UNTIL A SMOOTH PASTE IS
        FORMED

Bananas need much mastication, not for the purpose of reduction, but
for the purpose of insalivation.


RECIPES

RECIPE FOR CODDLED EGG

Place an egg in a pint cup; cover with boiling water and allow to
stand, covered, five or six minutes.


RECIPE FOR UNCOOKED EGGS

Break the number desired into a narrow bowl; add a teaspoonful of sugar
to each egg, and a pinch of salt; whip _very briskly_ with a rotary egg
beater from five to eight minutes.

To each egg a teaspoonful of lemon juice and half a glass of milk may
then be slowly whipped into the mixture, if desired.


RECIPE FOR BAKED OMELET

Whip two eggs very thoroughly for about five minutes; add a dash of
salt, a dessert-spoonful each of corn-starch and of heavy cream. Bake
very lightly in a small pan.


FISH AND FOWL

SELECTION AND PREPARATION

If we must eat the flesh of animals the young should be selected. It
contains more digestible protein, especially albumin, than the old or
matured animal, and has had less time in which to become contaminated
by unhygienic habits. Both fish and fowl should be baked, boiled, or
broiled; never fried.


RECIPE FOR PREPARING GREEN PEAS IN THE POD

After thoroughly cleansing the desired amount of fresh tender peas,
unshelled, put them into a covered pot or casserole dish; add a few
spoonfuls of water, a little butter and salt, and cook slowly until
thoroughly softened; serve in the pod.

The peas may be eaten by placing the pod between the teeth, and then
giving it a gentle pull. This strips off the outer coating or pulp,
leaving only the thin film of cellulose.

NOTE: The pea pulp, or substance upon the pod, is rich in mineral
salts, highly nutritious, slightly laxative, and an excellent aid
in the digestion of other foods. It is a better balanced and a more
valuable food than the pea.


PUMPKIN

Pumpkin may be made very delicious by stewing or boiling in just enough
water to prevent burning. Mash well and put through a colander. Season
and serve same as squash, or, prepare as directed, and bake until
slightly brown.


VEGETABLE JUICE

Chop fine and boil carrots, peas, asparagus, or any other fresh
vegetable from eight to ten minutes in sufficient water to make the
amount of juice required; strain and serve.

The tender parts of the fresh vegetable may be thoroughly cooked, put
through a colander, and served as a purée.


HOW TO MAKE SASSAFRAS TEA

Crush the bark of the red sassafras root, allowing a piece as large as
a silver dime to each cup. Add the quantity of water desired; simmer
from five to ten minutes. Drink with cream and sugar.


WHEAT BRAN

Wheat bran is the outer coating of the wheat grain. Chemically, it is
pure cellulose, which is insoluble and indigestible in the ordinary
digestive solvents of the body.

Wheat bran serves a valuable medicinal purpose in the stomach and
in the alimentary tract. When introduced into the stomach, its cell
structure fills with water, and it increases from four to eight times
its size in its dry state. It excites both stomach and intestinal
peristalsis, thereby preventing stomach indigestion, and by carrying
the water along down the intestinal tract, it prevents intestinal
congestion, or what is commonly called constipation. Wheat bran may be
properly called an intestinal broom or cleansing agent.

Man, in the process of preparing his food, has invented expensive and
complicated machinery for removing all cellulose and roughness from his
diet. He has suffered both stomach and intestinal congestion just to
the extent that this refining process has been carried on. Bran puts
back into the diet not only what modern milling methods have taken out
of it, but that which civilized habits of refining have eliminated
from our food. It therefore naturalizes the diet, promotes digestion,
cleanses the mucous surfaces of both the stomach and the intestines,
and prevents congestion in the ascending colon, which is the primary
cause of appendicitis, so called.


BRAN MEAL

Bran meal is the product of the entire wheat, ground coarsely, and
mixed with a certain per cent of wheat bran. It makes an excellent
bread.

Bread made from bran meal acts on the digestive and the alimentary
organs, the same as the pure bran, only in a milder capacity. It also
aids the stomach in the digestion of other foods. It is more nourishing
than wheat flour, for the reason that it is better balanced, containing
all the carbohydrate and the proteid elements of the grain.

Bread made from bran meal is better in the form of gems baked in small
gem rings.

This meal requires neither baking powder nor soda, and should not be
sifted.


CHOICE OF MENUS

Wherever two menus are given, choice may be exercised, but whichever
menu is chosen, it should be taken in its entirety. In other words,
do not select articles from one menu and combine them with articles
mentioned in another menu. Neither should any article of food be eaten
with a particular menu, other than that which is mentioned therein.
By observing these suggestions, the proper combinations of food are
observed, which is equally as important as the selections.

NOTE: In this volume there are some menus which contain combinations of
food classed as No. 3 in Lesson XII, "Tables of Digestive Harmonies and
Disharmonies," pp. 609 to 617 inclusive. This is explained by the fact
that said "tables" are laid out for the normal person, while the menus
were prescribed for the treatment of some special disorder, or for the
purpose of removing some offending causes.


NORMAL MENUS

The following menus are intended for those possessing normal digestion
and assimilation of food; that is, for those having no digestive
disorders.


INTRODUCTION TO NORMAL MENUS

While a majority of the menus composing this volume were prescribed
for the purpose of removing the causes of some specific disorder, a
vast number of those treated remained under the care of the author long
after they had become normal or cured, as the transition from dis-ease
to health is usually termed.

Another large number of comparatively healthy persons, recognizing the
relation between diet and health, came under the care of the writer for
the purpose of having their diet selected, proportioned, and balanced
according to age, occupation, and the season of the year.

The excellent results that were obtained, in nearly all such cases,
emphasized the importance of giving a set of normal menus for normal
people. All the following menus have been tested, under the direction
of the author, and have been chosen because they gave the desired
results.

CURATIVE MENUS

INTRODUCTION TO CURATIVE MENUS

Scientific investigation leads one inevitably to the conclusion that
a vast number of so-called dis-eases are caused by errors in eating;
that is, by wrong selections, wrong combinations and wrong proportions
of food. (See chart, Vol. I, p. 9, showing the number of dis-eases
caused by superacidity.) This chart will give the reader some idea of
the number of disorders that may originate from one source or from one
fundamental cause.

While superacidity is a true dis-ease, and may cause all the disorders
shown on this chart, yet behind superacidity there is a parent cause,
namely, wrong eating. In the light of these facts, it is obvious that
a department of curative and remedial menus should constitute an
important feature of this work.

For each patient who came under the care of the author (over 23,000 in
all), there was prescribed an average of six menus, covering a period
of six weeks. Each patient was required to keep an accurate record
of his or her diet, and the symptoms that developed after each meal.
This record was either brought to the author in person, or sent to him
through the mails.

From this vast amount of data and clinical experience, the writer was
enabled to select all the menus composing this volume, from those that
had proved successful in the various disorders treated. This volume,
therefore, is composed of only such menus as gave the desired results.
It represents the refined experience of twenty years' active practise
in Scientific Feeding.


MENUS FOR SUPERACIDITY


SPRING MENU

_ABNORMAL APPETITE_

_SUPERACIDITY_

Abnormal appetite is caused by the surplus acid which is left in the
stomach after digestion has taken place. This surplus acid causes
irritation of the mucous membrane of both the stomach and the pylorus.
The supersecretion of acid, in turn, is caused by overeating, by taking
foods in combination which are chemically inharmonious, by sedative and
intoxicating beverages, by tobacco, and by all stimulating drugs. The
logical remedy, therefore, is to omit the use of these things, and to
regulate the diet according to age, occupation, and chemistry, and to
drink copiously of water both at meals and between meals.

BREAKFAST

    Plain or flaked wheat, boiled very thoroughly; serve with butter,
      cream, and nuts
    A baked or broiled banana

LUNCHEON

    Purée of pea soup, made from the pod
    Baked potatoes
    One egg, boiled two minutes, or lightly shirred

DINNER

    Spinach or dandelion, cooked
    Boiled onions, peas, asparagus--any two of these
    A very small portion of tender fish (optional)
    A baked potato
    Gelatin or junket

NOTE: For all cases of superacidity, see "Importance of
Water-drinking," Vol. II, p. 434.

WINTER MENU


_SOUR STOMACH_ (_SUPERACIDITY_) _IRRITATION OF STOMACH AND INTESTINES_

On rising, drink two or three glasses of water, and take vigorous
exercise and deep breathing.

BREAKFAST

    Two heaping tablespoonfuls of plain wheat,
      thoroughly cooked, or simmered over night;
      eat with butter and nuts
    One or two eggs, either whipped or cooked two minutes

The entire meal may consist of boiled wheat and butter, with a very
little cream, unless the weather is exceedingly cold, in which event
the wheat may be reduced in quantity, and two, or even three, whipped
eggs taken.

LUNCHEON

    A liberal portion of baked sweet potato

    A small portion of tender fish or fowl; or, an egg preferred
    A baked potato
    Celery, or slaw, with nuts

Avoid overeating. Stomach fermentation is caused largely by taking
into the stomach a quantity of food in excess of digestive ability or
of bodily requirements. The logical remedy, therefore, is to limit the
quantity of food, or to increase the amount of physical exercise.

tablespoonfuls of bran may be taken in a little hot water. The quantity
of bran may be reduced according to the condition of the bowels.


SPRING MENU


_STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CATARRH_

Catarrh of the stomach is merely a form of chronic irritation caused by
a residue of hydrochloric acid in the stomach following the process of
digestion. This condition is augmented by intoxicating and stimulating
beverages--tobacco, liquor, beer, tea, coffee; by acids, such as
vinegar, lemon, grapefruit, and pineapple juices; by cane-sugar, cereal
starches, and meat. The remedy, therefore, is found in eliminating
these things, and in confining the diet to the following foods:

    All fresh vegetables     Milk
    Eggs                     Nuts
    Green salads             Subacid fruits
    Melon                    Very tender fish or white
                               meat of fowl--occasionally

Inasmuch as the primary cause of stomach catarrh is supersecretion of
hydrochloric acid, an abundance of pure water should be drunk at meals
and also between meals.

BREAKFAST

    A cup of hot water
    Egg whites, whipped, mixed with lukewarm milk; drink slowly

Drink a cup of hot water about 11 a. m.

LUNCHEON

Drink a cup of hot water about 4 p. m.

DINNER

    A cup of hot water
    Two fresh vegetables
    A new potato, baked
    Bran gems, with butter
    An egg, or a very small portion of either tender fish or chicken

Mastication must be perfect.

Bread, flour, and cereal products should be omitted, with the exception
of a very limited quantity of thoroughly cooked rice and wheat bran.

Sweets, desserts, tea, coffee, all sedative and stimulating beverages,
and drugs and narcotics should be omitted.

Water should be drunk copiously both at meals and between meals.

An abundance of cool water should be drunk between meals, and from one
to two glasses at meals.

Fevered stomach is caused by fermentation of food--hyperacidity. After
the diet is balanced so as to be chemically harmonious, the next most
important thing is copious water-drinking at meals and between meals.

See Vol. II, p. 434.

The emergency luncheon is to be taken if one does not like the regular
luncheon. The same rule should be observed with the emergency dinner.
The regular luncheon contains considerable protein, which is very
necessary in these conditions. The emergency dinner contains the same

    A pint of clabbered milk with a light sprinkle of sugar,
      if desired
    Two tablespoonfuls of clean wheat bran, well cooked;
      serve with cream

LETTER OF ADVICE

ACCOMPANYING ABOVE MENU

Rise at a regular hour every morning. Take a lukewarm sponge bath,
following it by a cool splash and a vigorous rub down, practising deep
breathing all the while.

Before dressing, devote from two to three minutes to exercises Nos. 3
and 5. (See Vol. V, pp. 1344 and 1345.) Take these movements calmly.

Do not worry. Masticate all food to infinite fineness. Take plenty of
time to eat.

Inflate the lungs to their fullest capacity one hundred times a day.
This is of very great importance.

If the quantity of food prescribed is more than the appetite calls for,
eliminate any one thing entirely, or reduce the quantity of the whole.

BREAKFAST

    A cup of coarse wheat bran
    Whole wheat, cooked until the grains burst open; serve with thin
      cream or rich milk, and either a spoonful of nuts or nut butter
      (This should be masticated exceedingly fine)

LUNCHEON

    One egg whipped very fine, or boiled one and one-half minutes; if
      whipped, add a sprinkle of sugar; if boiled, eat with a baked
      potato
    A very small vegetable salad--grated carrots, onion, and lettuce
      leaves

DINNER

    Boiled onions, carrots, or parsnips
    A baked white potato
    Half a glass of milk, mixed with one whipped egg white

Take a spoonful or two of wheat bran and a spoonful of pineapple juice
at the close of this meal, either cooked, or in hot water, uncooked.

The above menus are the minimum of food for this condition. The
quantity may be increased according to the demands of normal hunger.
Hunger, however, should be determined by labor or exercise. Abnormal
appetite, caused by supersecretion of acid in the stomach, is very
often mistaken for hunger. In such cases, the patient should cease
eating before the appetite is satisfied.


INDIGESTION (ACUTE)

In nearly all cases of acute indigestion, food should be omitted. The
patient should be given hot water morning, noon, and evening, and, if
possible, a stomach tube should be inserted, and the hot water and
stomach contents removed. If this cannot be done, the patient should
drink copiously of hot water, and vomit as much of it as possible.
After the stomach has been cleansed, a cup of coarse wheat bran, or
a large bunch of Concord or blue grapes may be given (if they are in
season), swallowing skins, seeds, and pulp. Both bran and grapes are
preferable to laxative medicines, and much more effective. The high
enema should be administered, thus removing the contents of the lower
bowels. After the stomach and the bowels have been thoroughly cleansed,
if the patient is not able to exercise, artificial manipulation of the
abdomen should be administered for a period of half an hour three
times a day. These suggestions may be repeated until the patient is
relieved, when the diet for chronic indigestion may be followed in
rather modified form, omitting the heavier vegetables, and increasing
the lighter foods.


MENUS FOR BILIOUSNESS


SPRING MENU

_BILIOUSNESS--HEADACHE SLUGGISH LIVER_

Supersecretion of bile by the liver is termed biliousness. This may be
expressed by the presence of bile in the stomach, which usually causes
headache, beginning at the base of the brain, and after five or six
hours settling over the eyes. This is sometimes associated with nausea
or sick headache.

Again, the excess of bile is absorbed into the blood, causing the skin
to become yellow and spotted, and sometimes it assumes the appearance
of jaundice.

Biliousness is caused by taking an excess of sweets, coffee, liquors,
fats, and sometimes starches--cereal, bread, etc. The remedy,
therefore, is a very simple one, and largely confined to elimination,
vigorous exercise, deep breathing, and copious drinking of water.

The following menus are suggestive. The diet may consist of any group
of fresh, natural foods which are in season.

MENUS FOR CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER


_CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER_

Cirrhosis is a word derived from the Greek meaning _yellow_. It was
originally intended to convey the idea of over-growth or enlargement of
this much-abused organ, but inasmuch as atrophic conditions often show
yellow or tawny, there are now two kinds of cirrhosis, namely, atrophic
cirrhosis, meaning a shrinkage, and hypertrophic cirrhosis, meaning
enlargement of the liver.

Atrophic cirrhosis is caused by alcoholism, often augmented by milder
stimulants such as tea and coffee.

Hypertrophic cirrhosis is caused by overeating, especially of meat,
sweets, and starchy foods.

The causes of the former should be removed by ceasing the use of tea,
coffee, and all alcoholic stimulants, and of the latter by omitting
sweets, and limiting the diet in quantity to, or in severe cases below,
the actual needs of the body.

The following menus are laid out for the treatment of severe cases.
They are designed both as a counteractive and as a remedial measure.

In mild cases, or as the patient recovers, the diet may be increased in
quantity, but it should be confined very rigidly to the articles named
in the list below, and in the menus which follow.

Foods to be used in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver:

    PROTEIDS          VEGETABLES        FRUITS

FIRST DAY: On rising, drink two cups of hot water. Also eat half a
pound of grapes, and devote from three to five minutes to exercises
Nos. 3 and 5. (See Vol. V, pp. 1344 and 1345.)

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
